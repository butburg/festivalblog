## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```bash
./bin/setup
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```bash
rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```bash
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

Open new terminal tab:

```bash
rails server
```
