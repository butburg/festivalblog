# Feature 2 - articles

This basic feature provides a basic content management system!

One article should contain the information for one event or festival with a simple title,
description and text for further information.
You can add, edit or delete them.
The homepage provides an overview of the created articles (events) from where you can access
them via a button.
Another side shows them simplified in a list to update or delete them.
