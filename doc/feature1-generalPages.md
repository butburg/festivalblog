# Feature 1 - general pages

This first basic feature provides the basic sites *Legal* (de: Impressum) and *About* !
They use dynamic content. A header and a footer are inserted by helpers so that they can be
easily changed on all pages at the same time. The title for the browser is also dynamic
and its defined by a helper function that builds a complete title by adding a static part to a
page-relative part.
